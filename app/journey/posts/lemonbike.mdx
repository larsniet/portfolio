I was assigned to make the website clear for both the computer, as well as the tablet and mobile phone. The UX/UI was created by a designer who was hired by Lemonbike to give the website a fresh look. I then converted this design into a web application that, among other things, supports multiple languages, displays all products that Lemonbike rents, is linked to the reservation and payment module, and answers the most frequently asked questions. The reservation and payment module has been efficiently set up together with an external company. It also supports multiple languages, and all reservations can be viewed on a computer in the branches themselves.

Lemonbike sets itself apart with its social mission. By renting out (and in some cases offering for free) special bicycles, people with physical and/or mental disabilities and their families can enjoy the Bollenstreek. Lemonbike branches can be found in Katwijk, Noordwijk, and Lisse.
