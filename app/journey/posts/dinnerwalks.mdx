# A culinary walk through the region
Dinnerwalks began as a small-scale project to support the hospitality industry, conceived by [Veerle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerle-killan-11a704149/) and [Merlijn Killan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merlijn-killan-091546182/). Soon, registrations started pouring in, and the process that used payment requests and manual emails became a significant burden. That's why Merlijn asked me for help. My task was to transform the outdated website into a modern and unique web application that automated the existing process.
