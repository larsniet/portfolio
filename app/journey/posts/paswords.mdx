# Paswords, the safe way to share passwords
Paswords is a web-app that enables you to generate and share passwords with whomever you want. The main purpose is to securely share passwords with other people by using a one-time-link system. Simply fill in or generate the password you want to share, set a timer for when the link should be invalidated, and the link will be automatically generated. You can then share the link with anyone you want, and they will be able to see the password you have shared. Once the link is opened, it will be invalidated and can no longer be used. Try it now on paswords.link.

Moreover, what sets Paswords apart is that it is open-source. This means that the source code is freely accessible to everyone and can be reviewed, contributed to, and modified by the community. It provides transparency, which is essential for a tool focused on security and privacy. The open-source nature of Paswords also enables developers to learn from the code, build upon it, and further improve the platform. It also promotes collaboration and innovation, which is crucial for maintaining the highest security standards. So, while you are using Paswords, you are contributing to a growing community that is dedicated to the security of online data exchange.
